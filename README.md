The XboxRobotEsp32 is a cool little project where I salvaged robot parts from a bunch of different kits and put them together to make a little car.

I use bluepad32 to connect a bluetooth Xbox controller to the Esp32, which I then use to drive around the robot.

I use SparkFun's TB6612FN motor controllers to drive the wheels, one of which came with a HackPack kit and the other that I ordered and soldered myself.
